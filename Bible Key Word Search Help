Hello, Thank you for your purchase of the Bible-Key Word Search Application.
This app is simple. Just search a word or phrase that you want to see in the bible.
If the word or phrase, or even partial phrase is in the bible- the results will display all occurences and the number of times it occurs.
This app will show you book, chapter, and verse that the search item/ items are found in.
Some tips are "jesus" Will display all occurences of Jesus.
Some words like "Answer" would be shown in the results as "Answered" and "Answer" 
If you want just to return all instances of "Answer" then hit the space bar one time after "Answer"
The search button will perform the search and display the results.
Feel free to place spaces before words and see what happens.
Also feel free to have an empty search bar then hit 1 space ( the entire bible shows)
If you need more help- email me at wesleypingleton@gmail.com

Enjoy your app!'
May God show you his ways through his WORD!
